DOCUMENTING THE DATE EVERYTIME I WORK ON THIS WEB PORTFOLIO


8/6/2025

Created this Website as an project on the side to get back into
working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files don't know how deep I
will create this, but would like to remember the process again. 
Created a clock, was able to adjust text file in the code and output what I wanted
few minor tweaks but maybe consider adding something like a blog or text of what I done recently
I could go something simple and then create some other things that would be cool to have

IDEAS:
1. Create small post/blog on the html side (nice to have and maybe consider but don't really know)
2. Could full blown create a RESUME out of this website but I think sticking to an email is perfered for now (wont take long for the website)
3. can create a very small game out it! don't know what would be the game but it something to consider
4. add them all into one web which is possible have multiple links to each other and go from there... (most likely tbh)
